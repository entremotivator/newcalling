```

## API Client Module

The `vapi_client.py` module provides a clean interface to the VAPI AI API:

- `VAPIClient`: Main client class for API interactions
- `validate_assistant_data()`: Data validation and cleaning
- `get_assistant_summary()`: Assistant information formatting
- Provider configurations and templates

## Dependencies

- **streamlit**: Web application framework
- **requests**: HTTP client for API calls
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and display

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Connection Failed**
   - Verify your API key is correct
   - Check that the API base URL is `https://api.vapi.ai`
   - Ensure your VAPI AI account is active

2. **Application Won't Start**
   - Check that all dependencies are installed
   - Verify Python version is 3.11 or higher
   - Look for syntax errors in the console output

3. **Features Not Working**
   - Ensure API connection is established
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Try refreshing the page

### Error Messages

- **"API not connected"**: Configure your API key in Settings
- **"No assistants found"**: Create your first assistant or check API connection
- **"Failed to create/update assistant"**: Check your API key and assistant configuration

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run with auto-reload
streamlit run app_improved.py --server.runOnSave true
```

### Code Structure

The application follows a modular structure:
- Main UI components in `app_improved.py`
- API interactions in `vapi_client.py`
- Configuration through environment variables
- Session state management for user data

## Deployment

### Local Deployment

The application runs locally on `http://localhost:8501` by default.

### Production Deployment

For production deployment, consider:
- Using environment variables for API keys
- Setting up HTTPS
- Configuring proper error handling
- Adding authentication if needed

### Docker Deployment (Optional)

Create a `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8501

CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app_improved.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
```

## Security Considerations

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Monitor API usage and costs
- Implement proper error handling
